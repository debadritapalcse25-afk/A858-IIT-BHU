**A858 IIT BHU**\n
**Challenge Overview**\n
We were given a challenge named A858 IIT BHU. The challenge involved multiple layers of puzzles ‚Äî starting with a text file and leading us through Pastebin, Reddit pages, cryptography, physical searching on campus, and finally reconstructing a QR code to retrieve the answer.

**Step 1: Initial File (AAA.txt)**
We received a file named AAA.txt on Discord.
‚Ä¢	The file contained many lines, each consisting only of the letter A, but with varying lengths.
‚Ä¢	We counted the number of A‚Äôs in each line.
‚Ä¢	These numbers matched ASCII codes, so we converted them to characters.
This gave us a **Pastebin link**. (Link: https://pastebin.com/kKTxgzFn)

**Step 2: Pastebin Clue**
On Pastebin, we found a clue:
‚ÄúTujhe dikh nahi raha hai lekin woh hai .‚Äù
This hinted at hidden characters (like spaces and tabs).
‚Ä¢	On examining the text, we discovered a sequence of spaces and tabs.
‚Ä¢	So we downloaded the file and changed it to .ws and decrypted it using a whitespace decoder.
‚Ä¢	This gave us a **Reddit link**. (https://www.reddit.com/r/858A/)

**Step 3: Exploring r/A858**
On the r/A858 subreddit, we found several leads:
1.	Post: "Help needed"
	The screenshot showed, at the top-left, another subreddit: r/Ali3n1nva5i0n.
	Visiting this subreddit, we discovered QR3 from a post: ‚ÄúThere you go‚Äù.
2.	Post: "Messi better"
	In the comments, a user named ‚ÄúImpossible_Fee7948‚Äù had a profile picture containing QR2.
3.	Post: ‚ÄúMy brain is Fried‚Äù
	This post contained a suspicious string: ‚ÄúCgOiYQ12hKFiQcpJiE4V08xoelFOd+922MFAUmKaxJi8djjO8lo5ezQgVO1OCs6+uKho9tGUJdlu9tIi9pHW5CFOquSZOTvQ/7AAiNl0/BkHN/IdnN4qXMaqfeDeb5+M0ezh0cjTdjZEGrySeyAo368ptDYqPkY2QLTRZoqcYho51m+us82aF/Ywoe1g7/JH‚Äù
4.	Post: ‚Äúfound a new cipher! the game of secrets just got fishy! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äù
	We found a Blowfish decryption code.
5.	Post: ‚ÄúHeaven‚Äù
	The image in the post contains a code on the top right corner (A858). We used this as the key.
6.	Post: ‚ÄúI love 4Chan‚Äù
	A comment contains a Clan Code of clash of clans: #2RYLCYCYG.

**Step 4: Blowfish Decryption**
‚Ä¢	Using the Blowfish decryption code, the key A858, and the suspicious string, we decrypted it.
‚Ä¢	The result was a Google Drive link: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ds5m4S-JxyGkd9vvzgOmuaS8Jig1-Hh/view)
The Drive folder contained an image of a tree with the number 3752.
________________________________________
**Step 5: Physical Search ‚Äì QR1**
We searched the IIT BHU campus for **tree 3752**.
‚Ä¢	Behind the tree, we found QR1.
________________________________________
**Step 6: r/A585 and Clash of Clans**
Using the Clan code
‚Ä¢	We joined the clan. Its description contained: ‚ÄúThe reward is in clan castle and my clan castle is at 82¬∞ 59' 18.8'' E ‚Äù.
‚Ä¢	This coordinate was within the bounds on the east coordinates of the campus of IIT BHU. So we concluded that this must be a place in the campus.
‚Ä¢	We mapped all places on the IIT BHU campus along this east coordinate.
‚Ä¢	The most probable location was **Annie Besant Lecture Theatre**.
Searching around ABLT, we discovered QR4 on the side of the building.

**Step 7: Final Assembly**
At this point, we had collected all four QR pieces:
‚Ä¢	QR1 ‚Äì Behind tree ‚Äú3752‚Äù
‚Ä¢	QR2 ‚Äì User ‚ÄúImpossible_Fee7948‚Äù profile picture
‚Ä¢	QR3 ‚Äì Subreddit Ali3n1nva5i0n
‚Ä¢	QR4 ‚Äì Near ABLT - 4
We joined the four pieces together to reconstruct the final QR code.
‚Ä¢	Scanning it led us to a website.
‚Ä¢	On the site, we logged in with our credentials and obtained the string for Challenge 5.
________________________________________
**Conclusion**
The A858 IIT BHU challenge was a multi-stage puzzle involving:
‚Ä¢	ASCII decoding
‚Ä¢	Whitespace Decoding
‚Ä¢	Reddit clue-hunting
‚Ä¢	Blowfish decryption
‚Ä¢	Physical treasure hunt on campus
‚Ä¢	Clash of Clans clue
‚Ä¢	QR reconstruction
This was one of the most engaging challenges as it combined both online cryptic hunt and real-world searching.
