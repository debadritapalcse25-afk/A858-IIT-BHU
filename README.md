**A858 IIT BHU**<br />
**Challenge Overview**<br />
We were given a challenge named A858 IIT BHU. The challenge involved multiple layers of puzzles ‚Äî starting with a text file and leading us through Pastebin, Reddit pages, cryptography, physical searching on campus, and finally reconstructing a QR code to retrieve the answer.<br />

**Step 1: Initial File (AAA.txt)**<br />
We received a file named AAA.txt on Discord.<br />
‚Ä¢	The file contained many lines, each consisting only of the letter A, but with varying lengths.<br />
‚Ä¢	We counted the number of A‚Äôs in each line.<br />
‚Ä¢	These numbers matched ASCII codes, so we converted them to characters.<br />
This gave us a **Pastebin link**. (Link: https://pastebin.com/kKTxgzFn)<br />

**Step 2: Pastebin Clue**<br />
On Pastebin, we found a clue:<br />
‚ÄúTujhe dikh nahi raha hai lekin woh hai .‚Äù<br />
This hinted at hidden characters (like spaces and tabs).<br />
‚Ä¢	On examining the text, we discovered a sequence of spaces and tabs.<br />
‚Ä¢	So we downloaded the file and changed it to .ws and decrypted it using a whitespace decoder.<br />
‚Ä¢	This gave us a **Reddit link**. (https://www.reddit.com/r/858A/)<br />

**Step 3: Exploring r/A858**<br />
On the r/A858 subreddit, we found several leads:<br />
1.	Post: "Help needed"<br />
	The screenshot showed, at the top-left, another subreddit: r/Ali3n1nva5i0n.<br />
	Visiting this subreddit, we discovered QR3 from a post: ‚ÄúThere you go‚Äù.<br />
2.	Post: "Messi better"<br />
	In the comments, a user named ‚ÄúImpossible_Fee7948‚Äù had a profile picture containing QR2.<br />
3.	Post: ‚ÄúMy brain is Fried‚Äù<br />
	This post contained a suspicious string: ‚ÄúCgOiYQ12hKFiQcpJiE4V08xoelFOd+922MFAUmKaxJi8djjO8lo5ezQgVO1OCs6+uKho9tGUJdlu9tIi9pHW5CFOquSZOTvQ/7AAiNl0/BkHN/IdnN4qXMaqfeDeb5+M0ezh0cjTdjZEGrySeyAo368ptDYqPkY2QLTRZoqcYho51m+us82aF/Ywoe1g7/JH‚Äù<br />
4.	Post: ‚Äúfound a new cipher! the game of secrets just got fishy! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äù<br />
	We found a Blowfish decryption code in the image of the post.<br />
5.	Post: ‚ÄúHeaven‚Äù<br />
	The image in the post contains a code on the top right corner (A858). We used this as the key.<br />
6.	Post: ‚ÄúI love 4Chan‚Äù<br />
	A comment contains a Clan Code of clash of clans: #2RYLCYCYG.<br />

**Step 4: Blowfish Decryption**<br />
‚Ä¢	Using the Blowfish decryption code, the key A858, and the suspicious string, we decrypted it.<br />
‚Ä¢	The result was a Google Drive link: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ds5m4S-JxyGkd9vvzgOmuaS8Jig1-Hh/view)<br />
The Drive folder contained an image of a tree with the number 3752.<br />

**Step 5: Physical Search ‚Äì QR1**<br />
We searched the IIT BHU campus for **tree 3752**.<br />
‚Ä¢	Behind the tree, we found QR1.<br />
________________________________________<br />
**Step 6: r/A585 and Clash of Clans**<br />
Using the Clan code<br />
‚Ä¢	We joined the clan. Its description contained: ‚ÄúThe reward is in clan castle and my clan castle is at 82¬∞ 59' 18.8'' E ‚Äù.<br />
‚Ä¢	This coordinate was within the bounds on the east coordinates of the campus of IIT BHU. So we concluded that this must be a place in the campus.<br />
‚Ä¢	We mapped all places on the IIT BHU campus along this east coordinate.<br />
‚Ä¢	The most probable location was **Annie Besant Lecture Theatre**.<br />
Searching around ABLT, we discovered QR4 on the side of the building.<br />

**Step 7: Final Assembly**<br />
At this point, we had collected all four QR pieces:<br />
‚Ä¢	QR1 ‚Äì Behind tree ‚Äú3752‚Äù<br />
‚Ä¢	QR2 ‚Äì User ‚ÄúImpossible_Fee7948‚Äù profile picture<br />
‚Ä¢	QR3 ‚Äì Subreddit Ali3n1nva5i0n<br />
‚Ä¢	QR4 ‚Äì Near ABLT - 4<br />
We joined the four pieces together to reconstruct the final QR code.<br />
‚Ä¢	Scanning it led us to a website.<br />
‚Ä¢	On the site, we logged in with our credentials and obtained the string for Challenge 5.<br />

**Conclusion**<br />
The A858 IIT BHU challenge was a multi-stage puzzle involving:<br />
‚Ä¢	ASCII decoding<br />
‚Ä¢	Whitespace Decoding<br />
‚Ä¢	Reddit clue-hunting<br />
‚Ä¢	Blowfish decryption<br />
‚Ä¢	Physical treasure hunt on campus<br />
‚Ä¢	Clash of Clans clue<br />
‚Ä¢	QR reconstruction<br />
This was one of the most engaging challenges as it combined both online cryptic hunt and real-world searching.
